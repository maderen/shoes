		<h2>GUNFIGHT</h2>
		<div class="adidas-Article">WE TEAMED UP WITH ARTBOX ON THIS PIECE FOR CREATIVE AGENCY GUNFIGHT. GUNFIGHT IS AN IN-HOUSE NEW STYLE AGENCY BASED IN LONDON. THEY OFFER THEIR CLIENTS A PROJECT-ONLY CREATIVE SERVICE AND ARE A PARTNER OF AWARD WINNING UK PRODUCTION COMPANY GREATGUNS.
		<br>
		WE WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DIRECTION EN PRODUCTION OF THIS INTRODUCTORY AND WERE INSPIRED TO GIVE THE ANIMATION THE LOOK AND FEEL OF A GRAPHIC NOVEL. THEREFORE, WE SEARCHED FOR CREATIVE WAYS OF PUTTING IT IN A WESTERN SETTING USING ALL CLICHÉS SUCH AS VAST, EMPTY LANDS, AN OLD DUSTED TOWN WITH A SALOON AND THE ALWAYS-PRESENT SWINGING DOORS.
		<br>
		<br>
		WITH EACH TURN OF A NEXT FRAME, WE WANTED TO VISUALIZE ICONIC ELEMENTS ON ONE HAND AND EXPLAINING THE STORY OF GUNFIGHT IN ANOTHER.
		<br>
		TO CREATE THE BEST EFFECT THROUGHOUT THE FILM WE COMBINED 2D AND 3D ANIMATION AND WE REALLY TRIED TO GRASP THE PAINTED 2D FEEL BY PROJECTION MAPPING.
		<br>
		<br>
		WE RELISHED THE OPPORTUNITY TO ANIMATE THIS PROJECT AND IF THAT WASN’T ENOUGH, OUR CREATIVE DIRECTOR TOOK CARE OF THE SOUNDDESIGN AND MUSIC.
		<br>
		<br>
		WE REALLY ENJOYED CREATING AND ANIMATING THIS WILD WESTERN SHOOTOUT!
