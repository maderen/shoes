		<div class="adidas-Article">WE WERE FILLED WITH ENTHUSIASM WHEN ADIDAS ASKED TO CREATE A COMMERCIAL FOR THEIR NEW PRODUCT CLIMAHEAT. EVEN MORE EXCITING IS THAT THE VIDEO WAS SET TO APPEAR ALL OVER THE WORLD FROM ENGLAND, RUSSIA TO CHINA AND KOREA. FURTHERMORE, WE GOT THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMBINE THE TWO DISCIPLINES WE LOVE MOST: LIVE ACTION AND MOTION GRAPHICS.
		<br>
		<br>
		WE WORKED TOGETHER WITH THE CREATIVE TEAM OF ADIDAS TO PRODUCE A COMMERCIAL THAT WOULD INTRODUCE THE CLIMAHEAT’S JACKET AND SWEATER FOR AN ONLINE GLOBAL CAMPAIGN, FEATURING CLIMAHEAT AS THE BEST IN CLASS WINTER PERFORMANCE PRODUCT.
		<br>
		<br>
		WE WANTED TO FIND A BALANCE BETWEEN EXPLAINING THE ACTUAL TECHNOLOGICAL BENEFIT OF THE PRODUCTS BUT AT THE SAME TIME GIVING IT AN INSPIRATIONAL STORY. THE FIRST DIRECTION WE PERFORMED BY TRAVELING THROUGH THE ACTUAL MATERIALS AND EXPLAINING ITS FUNCTION IN THE FORM OF A TECH RENDER SUCH AS THE ‘HEAT SEALS.’
		<br>
		<br>
		TWO ATHLETES THAT DEMONSTRATED THE PRODUCT EXECUTED THE SECOND DIRECTION, GIVING IT AN INSPIRATIONAL MESSAGE OF TWO PEOPLE THAT ARE TRAINING DURING THE DEPTHS OF WINTER.
		<br>
		<br>
		WE CHOSE TO GIVE THE SET A NIGHTTIME URBAN FEEL, ALTERNATED WITH A MOUNTAIN LOOK. THE RUNNER IN THE STORY TAKES PLACE IN AN URBAN SETTING WHO IS RUNNING ALONG OLD BRICK WALLS THAT ARE TOP LIT. THE DARK HIGH KEY LIGHTING FROM SURROUNDING LAMPPOSTS MAKES THE LOOK COMPLETE. THE HIKER IS SET IN A SNOWY MOUNTAIN WITH A SHORT LINE OF SIGHT. WE SEE HIM WALKING THROUGH HIGH SNOW AND WIND HITS HIS JACKET.
		<br>
		<br>
		THE LOCATION FOR SHOOTING THE MATERIAL WAS IN THE BRUYNZEEL BARRACKS WHERE WE BUILD UP A CITY AND SIMULATED A SNOWSTORM.
		<br>
		<br>
		THIS PROJECT WAS OUR KIND OF LIVE ACTION MEETS ANIMATION!</div>
